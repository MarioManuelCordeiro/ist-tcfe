% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to dimension and implement a BandPass Filter (BPF) with a central frequency of 1kHz and a gain at central frequency of 40dB. 
In order to build the circuit, we used 4 resistors, 2 capacitors and a 741 OPAMP.
 

In section 2, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. In section 3, the circuit's simulation analysis results are expressed in graphics and commented. Finally, in section 4, we will compare the simulation and theoretical values and in this way conclude our study.
